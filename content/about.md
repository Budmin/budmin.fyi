I'm Andrew Garvin and I’m a full-stack software developer from Orlando Florida. I find software to
be a unique craft that I love improving on, and learning new ways to solve hard problems. 
Most of my projects are in languages you'd expect (Python, TypeScript, Ruby, Go), but I'm always trying
different programming languages to see how they differ and what makes a language "good".

I'm currently tinkering with functional programming in Elixir and Scala.


### Work
I am currently working as a full-stack developer at [DealerFunnel](https://www.dealerfunnel.com/), a specialized communication and lead management platform designed specifically for the automotive industry.

### Hobbies
When I am not programming, I'm ususally trying to take my dog to as many hiking trails as I can find.
